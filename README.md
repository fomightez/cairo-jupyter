# cairo-jupyter

Cairo output displaying in a Jupyter notebook hosted via mybinder.org.

This should make development easier by enabling spawning active coding environments in any modern browser on any device, where one can change the code and see the resulting image displayed on the same page.

The [demonstration notebooks](http://mybinder.org/repo/fomightez/cairo-jupyter) even work on mobile devices.

## Inspiration

This is based on Stuaxo's [ipython_cairo](https://github.com/stuaxo/ipython_cairo)and MyBinder.org. See [here](https://github.com/stuaxo/ipython_cairo/issues/4#issuecomment-355009047) for some of discussion of getting it working in Binders launched from MyBinder.org.
